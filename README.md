# plex-aniMess
A Plex Media Server scanner for anime that isn't organized at all.

aniMess relies solely on the filename to determine which show, season, and series a file belongs to. The flexibility afforded
by this approach decouples the need for file orginization from software that should be able to organize it for you.
