# plex-aniMess
A Plex Media Server scanner for anime that isn't organized at all.

aniMess relies solely on the filename to determine which show, season, and series a file belongs to. This decouples the 
need for file organization from software that should be able to organize it for you.

This currently only supports TV series scanning - that's where I was experiencing a real problem with Plex's scanner 
anyway.
